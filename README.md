# VHDL Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) projects showcasing designs for various digital systems and hardware implementations. These projects are useful for learning, experimenting, and advancing skills in VHDL and digital design.

## üìÇ Project Overview

### Current Projects:
1. This VHDL module is a clock divider designed to convert an input clock signal (CLK_IN) of 50 MHz into an output clock signal (CLK_OUT) with a significantly lower frequency (approximately 1 Hz).
2. **[Project Name 2]**: Brief description of the project (e.g., a digital clock design with counters and multiplexers).
3. **[Project Name 3]**: Brief description of the project (e.g., a traffic light controller using finite state machines).
4. **...**: Add other projects as needed with a short summary.
