# VHDL Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) projects showcasing designs for various digital systems and hardware implementations. These projects are useful for learning, experimenting, and advancing skills in VHDL and digital design.

## üìÇ Project Overview

### Current Projects:
1. This VHDL module is a clock divider designed to convert an input clock signal (CLK_IN) of 50 MHz into an output clock signal (CLK_OUT) with a significantly lower frequency (approximately 1 Hz).

Architecture Declaration:

A constant TIMECONST defines a value that governs the number of cycles for each counting step.
Four signals (count0, count1, count2, count3) are declared to implement a multi-stage counter.
A signal D is used to toggle the output clock.
Process Functionality:

The process is triggered on rising edges of the CLK_IN signal.
It increments count0 at every clock cycle. Once count0 reaches TIMECONST, it resets and increments count1.
Similarly, when count1, count2, or count3 reach TIMECONST, they reset, and the next counter in the hierarchy is incremented.
Upon count3 reaching TIMECONST, the signal D toggles, effectively dividing the clock.
Output:

The toggling of D is assigned to CLK_OUT, generating a slower clock signal based on the cumulative division effect of all the counters.
2. **[Project Name 2]**: Brief description of the project (e.g., a digital clock design with counters and multiplexers).
3. **[Project Name 3]**: Brief description of the project (e.g., a traffic light controller using finite state machines).
4. **...**: Add other projects as needed with a short summary.
